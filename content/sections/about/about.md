If you're wondering how my name is pronounced, it sounds just like "Simon". If you already knew that, kudos to you! :-)

I'm a software engineer based out of Austin Texas. I currently work at Visa as a fullstack engineer for our Operations and Infrastructure team.

You can probably find me rock climbing at the gym or outdoors at the Green Belt! You can check out some route's I've climbed <a href="https://openbeta.io/u/wawaloo_17">here</a> on OpenBeta, an open source project I've been working on, alongside other climbers.
